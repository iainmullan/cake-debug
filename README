A very simple Console task for CakePHP to assist with the mundane task of switching the debug level in your app.

When the task is run with no arguments, displays the current debug level.

Supplying a value of 0, 1 or 2 as the first and only argument, will set the debug to that level

	usage: cake debug <debug level>
